# Tool description 
```
TOOL_DESCRIPTION="""Use this tool to propose an edit to an existing file. This will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.

When writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment
// ... existing code ...
to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.

For example:
// ... existing code ...
FIRST_EDIT
// ... existing code ...
SECOND_EDIT
// ... existing code ...

Make sure it is clear what the edit should be, and where it should be applied. ALWAYS make all edits to a file in a single edit_file instead of multiple edit_file calls to the same file. The apply model can handle many distinct edits at once."""
```

# Parameters:
- target_file (string, required): The target file to modify
- instructions (string, required): A single sentence written in the first person describing what you’re changing. Used to help disambiguate uncertainty in the edit.
- code_edit (string, required): Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. Use // ... existing code ... for unchanged sections.
- The instructions field should be generated by your AI model, not user input. Follow the tool description above nearly verbatim - terminology like “use it to disambiguate uncertainty in the edit” should be used. Example: “I am adding error handling to the user authentication function”

# Syntax

```python
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.MORPH_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://api.morphllm.com/v1",
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "morph-v3-large",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `<instructions>${instructions}</instructions>\n<code>${initialCode}</code>\n<update>${editSnippet}</update>`,
    },
  ],
});

const mergedCode = response.choices[0].message.content;
```
So we use the prompt above to generate "instructions", and code_edit; then use morph API to generate the full updated file; Given "instructions", "editSnippet" are generated by the tool call, then the initialCode is the current content of the file to be updated.

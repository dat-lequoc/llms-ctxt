# Implementing GPT-5 API: A Comprehensive Guide with Focus on High Reasoning Effort

## Introduction

OpenAI's GPT-5, released on August 7, 2025, represents a significant advancement in large language models (LLMs), building on the GPT series with enhanced reasoning, coding, and multimodal capabilities. It excels in complex tasks such as advanced mathematics (94.6% on AIME 2025 without tools), real-world coding (74.9% on SWE-bench Verified, 88% on Aider), and agentic workflows, including chaining dozens of tool calls in parallel or sequence. GPT-5 supports a 400,000-token context window (up to 272,000 input tokens and 128,000 output/reasoning tokens combined) and integrates text, vision, and built-in tools like web search, file search, and code interpreter.

This documentation provides a full guide to implementing the GPT-5 API, with a detailed emphasis on the "high" reasoning effort setting. The `reasoning_effort` parameter allows developers to control the model's "thinking" depth, where "high" maximizes quality for intricate problems but increases latency and cost due to additional internal reasoning tokens. We'll cover setup, syntax, examples, costs, reasoning mechanics, and best practices. All examples use the OpenAI Python SDK (version 1.x+), but equivalents in other languages or raw HTTP are noted.

**Key Highlights for High Reasoning Effort:**
- **Purpose**: Enables Ph.D.-level reasoning for tasks like multi-step problem-solving, debugging large codebases, or visual analysis (e.g., 89% accuracy on long-context retrieval at 128K–256K tokens).
- **Trade-offs**: Higher quality but 5–10x more tokens used internally, leading to higher costs and slower responses (e.g., 192 reasoning tokens for a simple query vs. 0 for minimal).
- **When to Use**: Ideal for high-stakes applications like scientific simulations, legal analysis, or creative ideation; avoid for speed-critical tasks like real-time chat.

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI Account and API Key**:
   - Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and verify your account.
   - Generate an API key from the dashboard under "API Keys." Store it securely (e.g., as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
   - GPT-5 access requires a paid plan (e.g., ChatGPT Plus or API credits). Free tiers may have limited quotas.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - **Python**: Use Python 3.8+. Install the OpenAI SDK: `pip install openai`.
   - **Other Languages**: Use official SDKs (Node.js, Java, etc.) or raw HTTP requests.
   - Set API key: 
     ```python
     import os
     os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-your-api-key-here"
     ```
   - For security, use a `.env` file with `python-dotenv`: `pip install python-dotenv`, then load with `load_dotenv()`.

3. **Model Variants**:
   - `gpt-5`: Full model for complex tasks.
   - `gpt-5-mini`: Faster/cheaper for defined tasks.
   - `gpt-5-nano`: Optimized for summarization/classification.
   - `gpt-5-chat-latest`: Non-reasoning version for ChatGPT-like interactions.
   - Use `gpt-5` for high reasoning.

4. **Quotas and Billing**:
   - Enable billing in your OpenAI dashboard. Start with $5–10 credits for testing.
   - Monitor usage via the dashboard to avoid rate limits (e.g., 10,000 RPM for GPT-5).

## API Overview

The GPT-5 API is accessed via the Chat Completions endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`), supporting conversational interactions. It uses JSON payloads for requests and responses. Key endpoints:
- **Primary**: `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` – For text generation, tool calls, and reasoning.
- **Responses API**: A higher-level wrapper for agentic tasks (e.g., automatic tool chaining).
- **Batch API**: For cost savings on large volumes (50% discount, but 24-hour processing).

Authentication: Include `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` in headers.

**High-Level Flow**:
1. Send a POST request with messages, model, and parameters (e.g., `reasoning_effort: "high"`).
2. The model performs internal reasoning (invisible to users but billed as output tokens).
3. Receive a response with content, usage stats, and optional tool calls.
4. Handle multi-turn conversations by appending previous messages.

## Syntax and Parameters

Requests are JSON objects. Core structure:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Solve this math problem step-by-step."}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 1000,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "reasoning_effort": "high",  // Key for detailed reasoning
  "verbosity": "high"  // Controls response detail
}
```

### Key Parameters
- **model** (string, required): `"gpt-5"` for full capabilities.
- **messages** (array, required): List of dicts with `role` ("system", "user", "assistant") and `content` (string or multimodal for vision).
- **max_tokens** (int, optional): Max output tokens (1–128,000). For high reasoning, set higher to accommodate explanations.
- **temperature** (float, 0–2, default 1): Lower (e.g., 0.2) for deterministic reasoning; higher for creativity.
- **reasoning_effort** (string, optional, default "medium"): Controls internal "thinking" depth.
  - `"minimal"`: Fastest, no/low reasoning tokens (ideal for simple queries; 0–10 tokens used).
  - `"low"`: Basic reasoning (20–50 tokens).
  - `"medium"`: Balanced (50–150 tokens).
  - `"high"`: Maximum depth for complex tasks (100–500+ tokens; e.g., chains thoughts like o1/o3 models).
  - **Detailed Reasoning**: At "high", the model simulates chain-of-thought (CoT) internally, improving accuracy on benchmarks like τ²-bench (96.7%). It generates "invisible" reasoning tokens before output, which are billed but not returned unless `stream: true` with verbosity high. Syntax in Python: `reasoning={"effort": "high"}` or directly `"reasoning_effort": "high"` in JSON.
  - **Impact**: Higher effort adds latency (2–10x) but boosts performance (e.g., +20% on visual reasoning). Not all tasks benefit; test empirically.
- **verbosity** (string, optional, default "medium"): `"low"` (concise), `"medium"`, `"high"` (detailed explanations). Overrides via prompt instructions.
- **tools** (array, optional): For agentic reasoning; e.g., `[{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather", "parameters": {...}}}]`. At high effort, GPT-5 chains tools reliably (e.g., parallel calls).
- **tool_choice** (string/object, optional): `"auto"`, `"required"`, or specific tools. Use for constrained reasoning.
- **stream** (bool, optional): True for real-time output; reasoning tokens may appear as `[reasoning]` chunks at high effort.
- **Other**: `top_p` (nucleus sampling), `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty` for fine-tuning.

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1723000000,
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Detailed response here...",
      "tool_calls": [...]  // If applicable
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 50,
    "completion_tokens": 200,
    "reasoning_tokens": 150,  // Visible at high effort
    "total_tokens": 400
  }
}
```
- `reasoning_tokens`: New field; counts internal thoughts (billed as output).

## Examples

### Python SDK Example: Basic High Reasoning Query
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a math expert."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n²."}
    ],
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.2,
    reasoning_effort="high",  # Enables deep step-by-step reasoning
    verbosity="high"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
print(f"Usage: {response.usage}")
```
- **Expected Behavior**: At "high" effort, the model internally reasons through induction, examples, and proof steps (e.g., 150+ reasoning tokens), outputting a thorough explanation.
- **Output Tokens**: ~300 (including explanations); reasoning adds ~200 invisible tokens.

### Multi-Turn Conversation with Tool Calls (High Reasoning)
For agentic tasks, like debugging code:
```python
# First message
response1 = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Debug this buggy Python code: def fib(n): if n <= 1: return n; return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)"}],
    reasoning_effort="high",
    tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]  # Built-in tool
)

# Append assistant message for next turn
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": response1.choices[0].message.content, "tool_calls": response1.choices[0].message.tool_calls}]

response2 = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=messages,
    reasoning_effort="high"
)
```
- **Reasoning Detail**: High effort chains tool calls (e.g., runs code, analyzes stack trace), explaining each step.

### Raw HTTP (cURL) Example
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum entanglement in detail."}],
    "reasoning_effort": "high",
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }'
```
- Parse JSON response for `content` and `usage`.

### Vision Example (Multimodal Reasoning)
Upload an image URL for high-effort analysis:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this chart for trends."},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/chart.png"}}
        ]}
    ],
    reasoning_effort="high"  # Improves visual reasoning by 20%
)
```

## Costs and Billing

GPT-5 pricing is token-based (1 token ≈ 4 characters). Reasoning tokens are billed as output tokens, making "high" effort more expensive.

| Model          | Input ($/1M tokens) | Output ($/1M tokens) | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| gpt-5         | 1.25               | 10.00               | Full reasoning; high effort ~5x output cost for complex queries. |
| gpt-5-mini    | 0.25               | 2.00                | Balanced; reasoning adds 2–3x. |
| gpt-5-nano    | 0.05               | 0.40                | Minimal; low reasoning overhead. |
| gpt-5-chat-latest | 1.25            | 10.00               | No reasoning; fixed cost. |

- **Reasoning Impact**: 
  - Minimal: ~$0.01–0.05 per query (low tokens).
  - High: $0.10–1.00+ (e.g., 200 reasoning + 100 output tokens = $0.003 at base rate, but scales with complexity).
  - Example Calculation: For a 100-token input query at high effort (200 reasoning + 150 output): Input cost = (100/1M)*1.25 = $0.000125; Output cost = (350/1M)*10 = $0.0035; Total ~$0.0036.
  - Cached Inputs: 20x cheaper ($0.0625/1M for gpt-5).
  - Batch API: 50% off for non-urgent jobs.
- **Monitoring**: Use `usage` in responses. High effort can hit $200/month for heavy use (e.g., 20M output tokens). Optimize by starting with "medium" and escalating.

**Cost-Saving Tips**: Use prompt caching, minimal effort for drafts, or nano for preprocessing.

## Reasoning Capabilities in Detail

GPT-5's reasoning is powered by internal CoT simulation, refined from o1/o3 models. At "high" effort:
- **Mechanics**: The model generates hidden thought chains (e.g., "Step 1: Recall theorem... Step 2: Apply induction...") before final output. This boosts steerability and reduces hallucinations.
- **Effort Levels Reasoning**:
  - Minimal: Direct response; no CoT (fast, cheap, but lower accuracy on hard tasks).
  - High: Full CoT with backtracking; e.g., for coding, it debugs iteratively (88% on Aider).
- **Benchmarks**: 96.7% on telecom reasoning; excels in long chains (dozens of tools).
- **Limitations**: High effort increases latency (5–30s); not infallible (e.g., edge cases in visuals). Verbosity "high" exposes some reasoning in output for transparency.

**Effort Selection Reasoning**: Choose based on task entropy. For math/coding: High (marginal gains of 15–30%). For summarization: Low/Medium. Experiment: Run A/B tests measuring accuracy vs. cost.

## Best Practices and Implementation Guide

1. **Start Simple**: Prototype with Playground (platform.openai.com/playground) to tune `reasoning_effort` without code.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Explicitly instruct for structure, e.g., "Reason step-by-step before concluding." This amplifies high effort.
3. **Error Handling**: Check `finish_reason` ("stop", "length", "tool_calls"). Retry on rate limits (429 errors).
4. **Optimization**:
   - Use `previous_response_id` for multi-turn to preserve context cheaply.
   - Constrain tools with regex/grammars for reliable high-reasoning outputs.
   - Monitor with logging: Track `reasoning_tokens` to refine effort.
5. **Scaling**: For production, use Agents SDK for observability. Migrate from GPT-4o by updating model name and adding `reasoning_effort`.
6. **Security**: Sanitize inputs; avoid sensitive data in prompts.
7. **Testing High Effort**: Benchmark on your dataset (e.g., accuracy on 100 queries). Tools like OpenAI's Prompt Optimizer can auto-tune.
8. **Common Pitfalls**: Overusing "high" inflates costs; not all queries need it (e.g., simple Q&A). Stream for UX but note partial reasoning exposure.
